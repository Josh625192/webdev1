         <h3>History</h3>
          <p>The world baseball classic first began in 2006. It was sort of a replacement for the Olympics since they knew that the sport was being removed from the Summer Games. Just like the World Cup, the event happens every four years except this time it will be after six years due to the pandemic. The 2017 World Baseball Classic was one of the most watched sporting events in history. It provided lots of iconic moments and memories for years to come which is why the upcoming one has a lot of hype surrounding it. Other than the fact that the United States will be very stacked.</p>

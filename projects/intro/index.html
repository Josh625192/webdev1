  <li>Anything positive regarding the Chicago Cubs</li>
  <li>Future of the Cubs and Bears but also this class. I took a web development class in high school and felt it would transfer well into other types of programming and as much as it did, it was really boring.</li>
  <li>Some of my other classes as a graphic design major that greatly prefers web development. I'm interested in broadening my horizons in that class but not excited about the other aspects of the classes.</li>
